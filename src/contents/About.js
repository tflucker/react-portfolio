                <h3>Full Stack Web Developer | Senior Specialist</h3>
                <p>I entered the world of computer programming at my first job after college as a software tester.  From there I started to teach myself how to code in multiple languages such as HTML, CSS, Javascript, Java, SQL, and a few others.  I built this website using React to further solidify my skills and gain experience in a new framework.</p>
                <p>I have been working as a software developer since 2014 with a few different government contractor companies, completing work such as building websites, creating web applications or micro-services, and other various tasks in the software development product lifecycle.</p>
                <p>I really enjoy the problem-solving aspects and the flexibility that software development allows for unique and creative solutions. If I don't have expreience with a language or framework, I enjoy expanding my skillset and knowledge to suit my current project. </p>
